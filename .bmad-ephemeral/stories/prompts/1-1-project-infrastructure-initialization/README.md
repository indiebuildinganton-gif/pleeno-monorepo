# Story 1.1: Project Infrastructure Initialization - Task Prompts

This directory contains task-specific prompts for executing Story 1.1 in Claude Code Web.

## Quick Start

1. **Read the manifest:** Start with [manifest.md](manifest.md) for complete execution instructions
2. **Execute tasks sequentially:** Follow the order listed below
3. **Track progress:** Update the manifest as you complete each task

| 2 | Set Up Shared Packages Structure | [task-02-shared-packages.md](task-02-shared-packages.md) | 20-30 min |
| 3 | Configure Code Quality Tools | [task-03-code-quality-tools.md](task-03-code-quality-tools.md) | 15-20 min |
| 4 | Set Up Supabase PostgreSQL Database | [task-04-supabase-setup.md](task-04-supabase-setup.md) | 15-25 min |
| 5 | Configure Environment Variables | [task-05-environment-variables.md](task-05-environment-variables.md) | 10-15 min |
| 6 | Set Up Deployment Environment | [task-06-deployment-setup.md](task-06-deployment-setup.md) | 30-45 min |
| 7 | Create Basic CI/CD Pipeline | [task-07-cicd-pipeline.md](task-07-cicd-pipeline.md) | 20-30 min |
| 8 | Install Shared Dependencies | [task-08-install-dependencies.md](task-08-install-dependencies.md) | 10-15 min |
| 9 | Document Setup Instructions | [task-09-documentation.md](task-09-documentation.md) | 20-30 min |

**Total Time:** 2.5 - 4 hours

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- ✅ Node.js 18+ installed
- ✅ Docker Desktop installed (required for Task 4)
- ✅ Git installed
- ✅ Vercel account created (for Task 6)
- ✅ GitHub repository created (for Task 6-7)

## How to Use These Prompts

### Method 1: Copy-Paste (Recommended)

1. Open a task file (e.g., `task-01-initialize-turborepo.md`)
2. Copy the entire contents
3. Open a new Claude Code Web session
4. Paste the task content
5. Let Claude execute the task
6. Verify success criteria
7. Move to next task

### Method 2: Direct File Reference

If Claude Code supports file references in your environment:

```
Execute the task in .bmad-ephemeral/stories/prompts/1-1/task-01-initialize-turborepo.md
```

## Task Dependencies

```
Task 1: Initialize Turborepo
  ├─> Task 2: Shared Packages
  │     ├─> Task 3: Code Quality
  │     └─> Task 8: Install Dependencies
  ├─> Task 4: Supabase Setup
  │     └─> Task 5: Environment Variables
  │           └─> Task 6: Deployment
  │                 └─> Task 7: CI/CD Pipeline
  └─> Task 9: Documentation (requires all previous tasks)
```

## Important Notes

### Task 4 - Supabase Setup
- **CRITICAL:** Docker must be running before starting
- **SAVE CREDENTIALS:** You'll need the Supabase credentials from Task 4 for Task 5
- First-time setup downloads ~1GB of Docker images

### Task 6 - Deployment
- Requires a Vercel account (free tier is fine)
- Requires a production Supabase project created at app.supabase.com
- Requires GitHub repository created

### Task 7 - CI/CD
- Requires GitHub secrets configured
- Sets up branch protection (may need admin access)

## Progress Tracking

Use [manifest.md](manifest.md) to track your progress:

- [ ] Task 1 completed
- [ ] Task 2 completed
- [ ] Task 3 completed
- [ ] Task 4 completed
- [ ] Task 5 completed
- [ ] Task 6 completed
- [ ] Task 7 completed
- [ ] Task 8 completed
- [ ] Task 9 completed

## Success Verification

After all tasks are complete, verify:

1. ✅ All 6 zones start with `npm run dev`
2. ✅ Supabase runs locally at http://localhost:54323
3. ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds (`npm run type-check`)
4. ✅ Linting passes (`npm run lint`)
5. ✅ All zones deployed to Vercel
6. ✅ CI/CD pipeline runs on GitHub
7. ✅ README documentation is complete

## Troubleshooting

See the "Troubleshooting" section in [manifest.md](manifest.md) for common issues.

## Next Steps

After completing Story 1.1:

1. Mark story status as "completed"
2. Review and document any learnings
3. Proceed to **Story 1.2: Multi-Tenant Database Schema with RLS**
