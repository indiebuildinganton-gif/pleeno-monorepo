# Product Brief: Pleeno

**Date:** 2025-11-10
**Author:** anton
**Context:** B2B SaaS Platform for International Study Agencies

---

## Executive Summary

Pleeno is a Software-as-a-Service operations and finance command center designed to transform how international study agencies manage student payments and commission tracking. By replacing fragmented spreadsheet-based workflows with an intelligent, automated platform, Pleeno provides complete visibility, control, and financial clarity across the complex three-way relationship between students, agencies, and educational institutions.

The platform addresses critical cash flow uncertainty, administrative burden, and financial risk that plague agencies operating in the international education sector—turning operational chaos into predictable, transparent business intelligence.

---

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

International study agencies operate in a perpetual state of financial anxiety and administrative overwhelm. Every student placement creates a complex web of payments, commissions, and documentation that must be tracked across three parties—student, agency, and college—yet most agencies manage this critical financial infrastructure using nothing more than spreadsheets, email threads, and manual reconciliation.

**The emotional reality:**

- **Sunday night dread**: Agency owners spend weekends manually updating spreadsheets, cross-referencing bank statements, and hunting down missing payment confirmations—time stolen from family and strategic work.

- **Cash flow paralysis**: Agencies have no clear visibility into when commissions will actually arrive. Are we owed $50,000 or $80,000 this quarter? Will the college remember to pay us in 60 days or will we have to chase them again? This uncertainty makes it impossible to plan hiring, marketing spend, or business growth.

- **The sickening feeling of missed money**: Discovering that a college "forgot" to pay a commission claim from 4 months ago—money that should have been in the bank but was lost in the administrative chaos. How many other claims have slipped through the cracks?

- **Distrust and friction**: Students don't understand why they're paying the agency instead of the college (or vice versa). Colleges delay commission payments because agencies can't provide clean documentation. Every stakeholder feels like they're being kept in the dark.

- **Scale ceiling**: Growing the business means exponentially more payment plans, more colleges, more complexity—but the spreadsheet-based system simply cannot scale. Agencies are trapped between wanting to grow and being terrified of the operational nightmare growth would create.

### Problem Impact

**Financial Impact:**
- **Lost revenue**: Agencies lose 5-15% of annual commission revenue to missed claims, forgotten follow-ups, and uncollected late payments
- **Cash flow volatility**: 60-90 day payment delays from colleges create unpredictable cash flow, forcing agencies to maintain excessive cash reserves
- **Administrative costs**: 15-25 hours per week spent on manual payment tracking, reconciliation, and college follow-ups—time that should be spent on student recruitment and relationship building

**Operational Impact:**
- **Error-prone manual processes**: Copy-paste errors, formula mistakes, and version control issues in spreadsheets lead to incorrect commission calculations and payment disputes
- **No single source of truth**: Payment status lives in scattered emails, spreadsheets, and mental notes—making handoffs between team members nearly impossible
- **Reactive management**: Agencies only discover overdue payments or missing claims when it's too late to easily recover them

**Emotional & Strategic Impact:**
- **Founder burnout**: Agency owners become trapped in administrative quicksand instead of building relationships and growing the business
- **Limited scalability**: The system that works for 50 students per year becomes completely unmanageable at 200 students
- **Professional credibility**: Agencies appear disorganized to both students and colleges when they can't provide instant payment status updates or clean financial reporting

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

**Generic accounting software** (QuickBooks, Xero):
- Built for invoice-based businesses, not the complex multi-party payment flows of international education
- Cannot model the unique relationship: Student pays → College receives → Agency gets commission (with 60-90 day delays)
- No automation for tracking commission eligibility, visa status changes, or payment plan modifications
- Requires extensive manual data entry with no intelligence about education industry workflows

**Spreadsheets** (Excel, Google Sheets):
- No automated payment status tracking—everything is manual data entry
- Cannot send notifications when payments become overdue or commissions are due
- No audit trail—who changed what, when, and why?
- Breaks down completely when multiple users need simultaneous access
- Zero business intelligence—no dashboards, no cash flow projections, no strategic insights

**CRM systems** (Salesforce, HubSpot):
- Designed for sales pipelines, not financial operations and payment tracking
- Cannot handle the precise commission calculations required (commissionable value minus materials/admin fees, GST considerations, bonus structures)
- No integration with actual payment data or bank reconciliation
- Too generic—requires expensive customization to model education agency workflows

**What's missing:** An intelligent system that **understands** the international study agency business model—where commissions depend on student enrollment status, payments flow through complex multi-party agreements, and cash flow forecasting is mission-critical but currently impossible.

### Proposed Solution

**Pleeno is the intelligent financial command center** that sits at the intersection of students, agencies, and colleges—bringing transparency, automation, and control to what was previously chaos.

**The transformation:**

**Instead of:** Opening 5 different spreadsheets, checking your email, logging into multiple bank accounts, and manually updating payment statuses...

**Agencies get:** A single dashboard that shows exactly where every dollar is—which students have paid, which commissions are pending, which colleges owe money, and what cash is expected in the next 90 days.

**Core Solution Architecture:**

1. **Centralized Truth System**
   - Single source of truth for all students, colleges, payment plans, and commission agreements
   - Role-based access for admins and agency users
   - Complete audit trail: who changed what, when, and why

2. **Intelligent Payment Plan Engine**
   - Flexible multi-installment payment plans per student
   - Auto-calculation of commissionable value (gross tuition minus materials, admin fees, GST)
   - Manual and automated installment creation
   - Support for complex college-specific commission structures and bonus arrangements

3. **Automated Payment Status Tracking**
   - Intelligent "bot" that automatically updates installment status based on real-time data:
     - **Draft**: Payment plan being created
     - **Pending**: Not paid, due date not reached
     - **Due Soon**: Auto-flagged N days before due date (proactive management)
     - **Overdue**: Auto-flagged immediately after due date passes
     - **Paid**: Student payment confirmed
     - **Completed**: Agency commission received from college
   - Centralized notes and payment agreements attached to each installment
   - No more manual status hunting—the system knows what's happening

4. **Predictive Business Intelligence Dashboard**
   - **Cash Flow Clarity**: Visual timeline showing past payments, current status, and 90-day forward projection
   - **Key KPIs**: Total commissions due, overdue amounts, income received, projected revenue
   - **Action Modules**: Automated lists of overdue payments and upcoming due dates for proactive follow-up
   - **Strategic Insights**: Top 5 colleges by revenue, new payment plans per month, trend analysis
   - Replace guesswork with data-driven decision making

5. **Enterprise-Grade Security & Compliance**
   - Multi-tenant architecture with complete data isolation (Row-Level Security)
   - Full audit logging for colleges, students, payment plans, installments, and user profiles
   - Complete traceability for compliance and dispute resolution

6. **Flexible Reporting Engine**
   - Filter by date ranges, colleges, students, payment status
   - Export to CSV/PDF for accounting and stakeholder reporting
   - Pre-built charts and KPIs (eliminating the need for Excel or Power BI post-processing)
   - Ad-hoc report generation for any question the business needs to answer

### Key Differentiators

1. **Built for education agencies, not adapted from generic tools**
   - Native understanding of student-agency-college payment flows
   - Commission calculation logic baked into the platform
   - Visa status tracking and enrollment-dependent commission rules

2. **Proactive automation, not passive record-keeping**
   - Automated payment status updates eliminate manual data entry
   - Intelligent notifications for upcoming and overdue payments
   - Cash flow forecasting that shows what's coming, not just what's happened

3. **Single source of truth with complete transparency**
   - Every stakeholder (student, agency, college) can see relevant payment status in real-time
   - Audit trail creates accountability and eliminates "he said, she said" disputes
   - Centralized notes replace scattered email threads

4. **Financial intelligence, not just financial records**
   - Forward-looking cash flow projections enable strategic planning
   - Business intelligence dashboards surface insights automatically
   - Strategic analysis tools (top colleges, trends, growth patterns) inform business decisions

5. **Enterprise security with SaaS simplicity**
   - Bank-grade security and compliance
   - Multi-tenant architecture scales effortlessly
   - No IT infrastructure required—login and start managing payments immediately

- College portal for commission claim submission
- *Rationale*: MVP optimized for agency internal operations. Portals add complexity and delay launch.

**Advanced Automation**
- Automated email notifications to students for upcoming payments
- Automated commission claim submission to colleges
- Workflow automation (if X then Y rules)
- *Rationale*: Core value is visibility and tracking. Automation can be layered in post-MVP.

**Mobile Applications**
- Native iOS/Android apps
- *Rationale*: Web-responsive dashboard sufficient for MVP. Mobile apps require separate development effort.

**Advanced Integrations**
- QuickBooks/Xero accounting software sync
- CRM integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot)
- Email platform integrations
- *Rationale*: CSV export handles basic accounting needs. Deep integrations can come after product-market fit.

**Multi-Currency Support**
- Currency conversion and multi-currency payment tracking
- *Rationale*: MVP targets single-market agencies. Multi-currency adds significant complexity.

**Advanced Financial Features**
- Invoicing and invoice generation

## Market Context

**Market Overview:**

The international education industry is a **$300+ billion global market**, with millions of students studying abroad annually. Study agencies serve as critical intermediaries—helping students navigate applications, visas, and enrollment while earning commissions from partner colleges.

**Target Market Segment:**

- **Small to mid-sized international study agencies**: 10-500 student placements per year
- **Geographic focus (initial)**: English-speaking markets (Australia, UK, Canada, USA) with high international student volume
- **Addressable market**: Estimated 5,000-10,000 agencies globally in target segment
- **Current solution**: 90%+ using spreadsheets for commission tracking (massive opportunity for disruption)

**Market Trends:**

1. **Industry professionalization**: Agencies increasingly expected to provide transparent, professional financial reporting to students and college partners

2. **Regulatory pressure**: Compliance requirements around financial tracking, student money handling, and commission disclosure are increasing globally

3. **Consolidation & growth**: Successful agencies are scaling rapidly—but spreadsheet-based systems cannot scale, creating acute pain point

4. **Commission complexity**: College commission structures are becoming more sophisticated (tiered bonuses, performance incentives, branch-specific terms)—spreadsheets cannot handle this complexity

**Competitive Landscape:**

**Direct competitors:** None. No purpose-built payment tracking platform exists for international study agencies.

**Indirect competitors:**
- **Spreadsheets (Excel/Google Sheets)**: 90% market share but fundamentally broken for this use case
- **Generic accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero)**: Not designed for multi-party payment flows, requires extensive customization
- **Agency management systems (e.g., Adventus, Studylink)**: Focus on CRM and student management, weak or non-existent commission tracking features
- **Custom-built solutions**: Large agencies build internal tools, but prohibitively expensive for small-medium agencies

**Market Opportunity:**

**Greenfield opportunity**: No entrenched competitor means low switching costs and high willingness to adopt a purpose-built solution

**Pain-driven adoption**: Agencies are actively suffering (lost revenue, time waste, cash flow uncertainty)—making them eager for solutions

**Network effects potential**: As more agencies adopt Pleeno, potential for college-side integration creates strong moat

**Expansion opportunities**: International study agencies also need CRM, student management, document tracking—Pleeno can expand into adjacent workflows once payment tracking is solved

- Customer acquisition through content marketing and agency networks is viable (assumed)

### Key Risks

**Market Risks:**

1. **Adoption resistance**: Agencies may resist migrating from familiar spreadsheets despite pain points
   - *Mitigation*: Provide easy data migration tools, offer hands-on onboarding support, demonstrate ROI within first week

2. **Market size**: Addressable market may be smaller than estimated if agencies consolidate or use existing CRM systems
   - *Mitigation*: Validate market size through pilot program, plan for expansion into adjacent markets (student recruitment agencies, visa consultants)

3. **Competition emergence**: Established players (CRM vendors, accounting software) could add similar features
   - *Mitigation*: Move fast, build deep domain expertise, create network effects through college integrations

**Product Risks:**

1. **Complexity underestimation**: Commission calculation logic may be more complex than anticipated across diverse college agreements
   - *Mitigation*: Start with pilot agencies, iterate on calculation engine based on real-world edge cases

2. **Automation reliability**: Automated status tracking bot may produce incorrect states due to edge cases
   - *Mitigation*: Build manual override capabilities, comprehensive testing, clear audit trail to catch errors

3. **Performance at scale**: Dashboard and reporting may slow down as data volume grows
   - *Mitigation*: Performance testing with synthetic data, database optimization, caching strategy

**Business Risks:**

1. **Customer acquisition cost**: CAC may be higher than expected if agencies are hard to reach or skeptical
   - *Mitigation*: Focus on word-of-mouth and referrals from pilot agencies, targeted content marketing

2. **Churn risk**: Agencies may churn if they don't achieve immediate value or find product too complex
   - *Mitigation*: Strong onboarding, responsive support, continuous user feedback loops

3. **Revenue model uncertainty**: Optimal pricing model (per-user, per-student, flat fee) is unknown
   - *Mitigation*: Test multiple pricing models with pilot agencies, be willing to iterate quickly

### Open Questions Requiring Research

1. **Pricing sensitivity**: What is the maximum monthly price agencies will pay? Does pricing vary by agency size?
2. **Feature prioritization**: Which MVP features drive the most value? Can any be deferred to accelerate launch?
3. **Integration needs**: Do agencies require accounting software integration for MVP, or is CSV export sufficient?
4. **Competitive intelligence**: Are there regional competitors or niche players we haven't identified?
5. **College partner engagement**: Would colleges be willing to integrate with Pleeno for automated commission claims (future feature)?
