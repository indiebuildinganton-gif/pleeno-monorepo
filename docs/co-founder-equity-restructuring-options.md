## Executive Summary

This document analyzes strategic options for restructuring a three-way co-founder partnership where:
- **You (anton)**: Technical co-founder who built 100% of the Pleeno CRM platform
- **Co-founder 1**: Business-first founder (Industrial Engineer, Colombian-Australian, has existing PTY LTD)
- **Co-founder 2**: Financial Analyst & SME (Sales background, Colombian-Australian citizen, has existing PTY LTD)

**Core Misalignment:**
- You want to focus solely on CRM software business (SaaS product)
- Co-founders want to expand into regulated escrow/financial services (AUSTRAC compliance required)
- Current equity structure undefined but likely assumes equal/majority to co-founders
- You have no corporate entity, they each have existing PTY LTD companies

**Decision Required:** How to structure ownership, risk, and business operations to align interests while preserving the partnership.

## Context & Current Situation

### What You Built
- **Pleeno CRM**: Complete SaaS platform per [PRD.md](PRD.md)
- Multi-tenant B2B application for international study agencies
- Payment tracking, commission management, automated status intelligence, dashboard analytics
- Full technical stack: Database, backend, frontend, deployment infrastructure
- **Your Contribution**: 100% technical execution from conception to production-ready system

### What They Contributed
- **Customer Discovery**: Validated pain points in international education agency market
- **Domain Expertise**: Subject matter knowledge of commission tracking, payment workflows, agency operations
- **Market Access**: Existing relationships with prospect customers
- **Business Development**: Ongoing customer conversations and pipeline building
- **Regulatory Navigation**: Understanding AUSTRAC requirements for future escrow services

### Current Legal Structure
- **Co-founder 1**: Has existing PTY LTD company (name unknown)
- **Co-founder 2**: Has existing PTY LTD company (name unknown)
- **You**: No corporate entity established
- **Pleeno Product**: Ownership and IP assignment currently UNDEFINED (critical risk!)
- **Location**: Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia (subject to Australian corporate law)

### Future Divergence
- **Their Vision**: Pleeno CRM + Escrow Services (AUSTRAC-regulated financial services)
- **Your Vision**: Pleeno CRM only (SaaS software, no financial services regulation)
- **Risk Exposure**: Escrow services require AUSTRAC registration, AML/CTF compliance, significant regulatory burden
- **Skill Mismatch**: You're a software builder, not a financial services operator

## Critical Questions Requiring Immediate Answers

### 1. Current IP Ownership Status
**URGENT - Legal Risk**

- [ ] **Who currently owns the Pleeno codebase?**
  - Is there a signed IP assignment agreement?
  - Was code developed as "work for hire" for one of their PTY LTD entities?
  - Or is IP ownership currently ambiguous/unassigned?

- [ ] **Who owns the "Pleeno" brand/trademark?**
  - Has anyone registered the trademark in Australia?
  - Which entity (if any) owns the domain, social media, brand assets?

- [ ] **Is there a signed Founders Agreement or Shareholders Agreement?**
  - If YES: Review immediately with lawyer (may define equity and IP ownership)
  - If NO: IP ownership may default to you as creator (Australian copyright law) BUT this is disputed territory

**⚠️ CRITICAL ACTION:** If no IP assignment exists, you may own the code by default under Australian Copyright Act 1968. However, if you developed it "in the course of employment" for their company, they may own it. GET LEGAL ADVICE IMMEDIATELY.

### 2. Customer Pipeline Attribution
**Determines Your Negotiating Leverage**

- [ ] **How many total qualified leads/prospects exist?**
  - Number: ___________

- [ ] **Who sourced each lead?**
  - Co-founder 1 network: _____%
  - Co-founder 2 network: _____%
  - Organic/product-led: _____%
  - Other: _____%

- [ ] **What is the CRM-only vs. CRM+Escrow demand split?**
  - Customers who want CRM only: _____%
  - Customers who REQUIRE escrow to buy: _____%
  - Customers who prefer bundled but would buy CRM alone: _____%

**Validation Required:** Interview 5-10 prospects with question: *"Would you pay $149/month for the CRM even if we never offered escrow services?"*

### 3. Revenue Potential Analysis
**Determines Standalone CRM Viability**

- [ ] **Addressable Market Size (Gold Coast → Queensland → Australia → International)**
  - Total international study agencies in Australia: _________ (research required)
  - Agencies in target size range (10-500 students/year): _________ (research required)
  - Realistic 3-year market penetration: _________ agencies × $149-399/month = $_________ ARR

- [ ] **Competitive Landscape**
  - Direct CRM competitors targeting study agencies: _________ (research required)
  - Generic CRM tools agencies currently use: _________ (research required)
  - Existing escrow service providers: _________ (research required)

- [ ] **Revenue Projections (CRM-Only Business)**
  - Year 1: _____ customers × $_____ MRR = $_____ ARR
  - Year 2: _____ customers × $_____ MRR = $_____ ARR
  - Year 3: _____ customers × $_____ MRR = $_____ ARR

- [ ] **Revenue Projections (Escrow Business - for comparison)**
  - Average transaction value: $_____
  - Escrow fee percentage: _____%
  - Transactions per agency per year: _____
  - Year 1 revenue potential: $_____

### 4. Your Go-To-Market Capability Assessment
**Critical Self-Assessment - Be Brutally Honest**

- [ ] **Can you handle sales & marketing for CRM independently?**
  - Sales experience: ☐ Yes, confident ☐ Learning curve, possible ☐ No, need to hire/partner
  - Marketing experience: ☐ Yes, confident ☐ Learning curve, possible ☐ No, need to hire/partner
  - Network in target industry: ☐ Strong ☐ Moderate ☐ Weak/None

- [ ] **Can you handle customer success & operations?**
  - Onboarding new customers: ☐ Yes ☐ With training ☐ No
  - Support & troubleshooting: ☐ Yes ☐ With training ☐ No
  - Retention & upselling: ☐ Yes ☐ With training ☐ No

- [ ] **Financial capacity to operate CRM business independently**
  - Can you afford 6-12 months runway without salary? ☐ Yes ☐ No
  - Can you invest $20K-50K in initial marketing/sales? ☐ Yes ☐ No
  - Need immediate revenue to survive? ☐ Yes ☐ No

**Interpretation:**
- If mostly "Yes, confident" → You can operate independently (leverage for 60-75% equity)
- If mostly "Learning curve, possible" → You need their involvement (aim for 50-60% equity with defined roles)
- If mostly "No" → You're dependent on them for commercial success (realistic equity: 40-50%, or exit and take licensing deal)

#### Protective Agreements

**1. Shareholders Agreement (Both Entities)**

**Key Clauses:**
- **Vesting Schedule**: 4-year vest, 1-year cliff (standard startup vesting)
  - If founder leaves before 1 year: Forfeits all unvested shares
  - After 1 year: 25% vested, remaining vests monthly over 36 months

- **Tag-Along Rights**: If majority shareholder sells, minority can join the sale at same terms

- **Drag-Along Rights**: If 75% of shareholders approve sale, all must sell

- **Right of First Refusal (ROFR)**: If shareholder wants to sell, other shareholders get first option to buy at offered price

  - Co-founders cannot build competing CRM for study agencies while shareholders

- **Non-Compete (Escrow Company)**:
  - Co-founders cannot build competing escrow service while shareholders

- **Deadlock Resolution**:
  - Mediation required before legal action
  - Shotgun clause: If irreconcilable disagreement, one party offers to buy other at stated price, other party can accept or buy at same price

**2. IP Assignment Agreement**

**Critical for CRM Company:**
- All existing Pleeno CRM code, documentation, design assets assigned to Pleeno Software Pty Ltd
- Anton signs IP assignment as individual → company (ensures company owns IP, not individual)
- Any IP developed during employment/engagement automatically assigned to company
- Exceptions: Anton's pre-existing IP/tools used in development (list specifically)

**3. Brand & Trademark Agreement**

- "Pleeno" trademark registered to Pleeno Software Pty Ltd (CRM company owns brand)
- Escrow company licenses "Pleeno Financial Services" brand from Software company
- Brand licensing fee: Included in software licensing agreement or separate nominal fee
- Termination: If license ends, escrow company must rebrand within 6 months

**4. Non-Solicitation Agreement**

- Neither company can poach employees from the other without written consent

- Protects against talent raids if relationship sours

**5. Confidentiality & Data Sharing Agreement**

- Customer data remains confidential between entities
- CRM company cannot market directly to escrow company's customers without permission
- Escrow company cannot share CRM customer data with third parties

### Advantages of Option 1

✅ **Risk Isolation**
- You are NOT exposed to AUSTRAC compliance failures, financial services litigation, or regulatory penalties
- Escrow business problems don't threaten CRM business continuity
- Separate legal liability shields

✅ **Control & Ownership**
- You own majority of what you built (60-75% CRM equity)
- Full decision-making authority on CRM product roadmap, pricing, operations
- No veto power from co-founders on technical decisions

✅ **Revenue Diversification**
- CRM company earns from: (1) Direct SaaS customers, (2) Licensing to escrow company
- Not dependent on escrow business success for survival

✅ **Scalability**
- CRM can be sold to ANY study agency (escrow customers + non-escrow customers)
- Escrow company is one customer/partner, not the only customer
- Potential to license CRM to other escrow providers (competitive advantage)

✅ **Exit Optionality**
- CRM company can be acquired independently (SaaS acquirers don't want escrow regulatory burden)
- You can exit CRM company via acquisition without affecting escrow business
- Cleaner cap table for investors (if you raise funding for CRM growth)

✅ **Align Incentives**
- Each founder focuses on their strengths: You = product, They = financial services
- Compensation tied to performance in respective businesses
- No resentment over "who's working harder" because success metrics are separate

### Disadvantages of Option 1

❌ **Relationship Complexity**
- Requires mature, trust-based relationship between founders
- More legal agreements to negotiate and maintain
- Potential for disputes over licensing fees, revenue share, brand usage

❌ **Potential Co-Founder Resentment**
- They may feel "cheated" if they perceive CRM as joint effort but get minority stake
- Risk of them saying: "We brought the idea and customers, why should we get 20%?"
- Could damage relationship if not positioned carefully as win-win

❌ **Customer Confusion**
- Two "Pleeno" companies may confuse market
- Customers may not understand why there are separate entities
- Marketing requires clear messaging about relationship

❌ **Reduced Leverage for Escrow Business**
- Escrow company pays licensing fees, reducing profitability
- If escrow business struggles, they may resent paying CRM license
- Potential for escrow company to try to build/buy competing CRM to avoid fees

❌ **Coordination Overhead**
- Two boards, two sets of financials, two tax returns
- Licensing agreement requires ongoing management and potential renegotiation
- Integration between CRM and escrow features requires cross-company coordination

### Australian Legal Considerations (Gold Coast, QLD)

**Corporate Structure:**
- PTY LTD = Proprietary Limited Company (Australian private company structure)
- Regulated by Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC)
- Requires: Registered office in Australia, at least 1 director (Australian resident), shareholders agreement

**AUSTRAC Registration (Escrow Business):**
- Required for "Remittance Service Providers" under AML/CTF Act 2006
- Registration fee: ~$1,000 (one-time)
- Compliance program required: Customer identification, transaction monitoring, suspicious matter reporting
- Annual compliance costs: $20K-100K+ (depends on transaction volume and complexity)
- Penalties for non-compliance: Up to $21 million AUD for companies

**Tax Considerations:**
- Corporate tax rate: 25% (for base rate entities with turnover <$50M)
- GST registration required if turnover >$75K (likely for both businesses)
- Dividend imputation: Franking credits available to Australian shareholders
- Cross-entity transactions: Licensing fees are tax-deductible expense for escrow company, taxable income for CRM company (consult tax advisor for transfer pricing rules)

**Startup Incentives:**
- R&D Tax Incentive: 43.5% refundable offset for eligible R&D (CRM software development may qualify)
- Early Stage Innovation Company (ESIC) tax concessions: 20% tax offset for investors (if you raise capital)

**Queensland Specific:**
- No state-level corporate taxes beyond federal requirements
- Payroll tax threshold: $1.3M (annual wages) - unlikely to hit in early years
- Gold Coast location: Access to startup ecosystem (e.g., Silicon Coast), co-working spaces, local angel investors

## Option 2: Single Entity with Redefined Equity & Roles

│   OR weighted voting based on equity        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### When This Makes Sense

**Choose Option 2 IF:**
- Customer demand is 80%+ bundled (customers won't buy CRM without escrow)
- You have limited/no sales capability and are fully dependent on their customer relationships
- The relationship is strong and you trust them as business partners
- You're willing to accept escrow risk in exchange for adequate equity compensation
- Splitting entities would create more problems than it solves (customer confusion, operational complexity)

### Detailed Terms

**Equity Structure (Negotiation Range):**

| Scenario | Anton | Co-founder 1 | Co-founder 2 | Rationale |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Scenario A: Technical Premium** | 50% | 30% | 20% | You built 100% of product, they handle sales/ops equally |
| **Scenario B: Balanced** | 45% | 32.5% | 22.5% | Recognizes your technical contribution + their combined commercial contribution |
| **Scenario C: Commercial Premium** | 40% | 35% | 25% | They brought all customers, domain expertise, and will run escrow business |

**Vesting:**
- All equity: 4-year vest, 1-year cliff
- Accelerated vesting triggers: Acquisition (50% single-trigger), termination without cause (100%)

**Roles & Decision-Making:**

**Option 2A: Co-CEO Structure**
- **Anton**: Co-CEO / CTO (product, technology, CRM operations)
- **Co-founder 1**: Co-CEO / COO (business operations, sales, escrow operations)
- **Co-founder 2**: CFO / Compliance Officer (finance, AUSTRAC compliance)
- **Major decisions**: Require 2 of 3 co-founders to approve (prevents deadlock)

**Option 2B: Clear CEO Hierarchy**
- **Co-founder 1**: CEO (final decision authority)
- **Anton**: CTO (product authority, reports to CEO)
- **Co-founder 2**: CFO (finance authority, reports to CEO)
- **Board**: 3 directors (all co-founders), major decisions require majority vote

**Division of Responsibilities:**

| Area | Owner | Backup |
|------|-------|--------|
| Product Development (CRM) | Anton | - |
| Infrastructure & DevOps | Anton | - |
| Customer Support (Technical) | Anton | Co-founder 2 |
| Sales & Marketing | Co-founder 1 | Co-founder 2 |
| Customer Success (Non-technical) | Co-founder 2 | Co-founder 1 |
| Escrow Operations | Co-founder 1 + 2 | - |
| AUSTRAC Compliance | Co-founder 2 | Legal counsel |
| Financial Management | Co-founder 2 | Accountant |
| Strategic Planning | All 3 co-founders | - |

**Protective Clauses (Critical for You):**

1. **Veto Rights for Anton on CRM Decisions:**
   - Any changes to CRM product roadmap require your approval
   - Hiring/firing of technical team requires your approval
   - Technology stack changes require your approval
   - Prevents them from overruling your technical judgment

2. **Budget Allocation:**
   - Minimum 40% of company resources allocated to CRM development (prevents escrow from starving CRM)
   - Separate P&L tracking for CRM vs. Escrow divisions
   - Bonuses tied to divisional performance (you get CRM upside even if escrow struggles)

3. **Exit Rights:**
   - If company pivots away from CRM (e.g., becomes escrow-only), you have right to buy CRM division at fair market value
   - If escrow business creates material regulatory liability, you have right to trigger company sale
   - Tag-along rights on any sale (you can't be left behind)

4. **Earnout Protection:**
   - If acquired, earnout based on CRM performance (not escrow) protects your contribution
   - Example: $2M upfront + $3M earnout if CRM revenue hits $2M ARR (you get proportional benefit)

### Advantages of Option 2

✅ **Unified Customer Experience**
- Single brand, single sales process
- CRM + Escrow deeply integrated (competitive advantage)
- No confusion about "which Pleeno company am I working with?"

✅ **Simpler Operations**
- One entity, one board, one tax return
- No licensing agreements to manage
- Easier to raise investment (single cap table)

✅ **Stronger Competitive Moat**
- Integrated CRM + Escrow is hard for competitors to replicate
- Network effects: More escrow customers → better CRM data → better product

✅ **Shared Resources**
- Customer success team serves both CRM and escrow customers
- Marketing budget benefits both products
- Economies of scale on legal, accounting, infrastructure

✅ **Preservation of Relationship**
- Less likely to create resentment vs. splitting entities
- "We're all in this together" mentality
- Avoids perception of you "taking the valuable asset (CRM) and leaving them behind"

### Disadvantages of Option 2

❌ **Escrow Regulatory Risk Exposure**
- You are a shareholder/director of AUSTRAC-registered entity
- Potential personal liability if escrow business fails compliance (research director liability laws)
- Reputational risk if escrow business has regulatory issues

❌ **Shared Control / Potential Deadlock**
- Major decisions require consensus or majority vote
- Risk of 2 co-founders outvoting you on CRM decisions (even with veto rights, this creates conflict)
- Slower decision-making vs. full control

❌ **Diluted Upside**
- You only own 40-50% of CRM value (vs. 60-75% in Option 1)
- If CRM becomes very valuable, you leave significant equity on the table

❌ **Resource Allocation Conflicts**
- Tension over budget: "Should we invest in CRM features or escrow compliance?"
- Escrow may demand more resources as it scales (regulatory requirements grow)
- Risk of CRM becoming "the side project" if escrow takes off

❌ **Exit Complexity**
- Harder to sell company (acquirers may not want escrow regulatory burden)
- Escrow business may reduce CRM valuation (buyers discount for regulatory risk)
- Harder to exit individually (you can't sell CRM separately)

### Australian Legal Considerations

**Director Liability (Critical for You):**
- Directors of Australian companies have legal duties under Corporations Act 2001:
  - Duty of care and diligence
  - Duty to act in good faith in company's best interests
  - Duty not to improperly use position or information
- **Personal Liability Risk**: Directors can be personally liable for:
  - Insolvent trading (if company incurs debts while insolvent)
  - Unpaid employee entitlements (superannuation, wages)
  - Certain tax obligations
  - AML/CTF breaches (AUSTRAC penalties can extend to directors if negligent)

**Mitigation:**
- Directors & Officers (D&O) insurance: $5K-20K/year (essential if you're a director)
- Ensure escrow business has adequate capital reserves (avoid insolvency risk)
- Independent compliance audits to demonstrate good faith efforts on AUSTRAC compliance

**Shareholder Protections:**
- Shareholders agreement must include:
  - Dispute resolution mechanism (mediation → arbitration)
  - Deadlock provisions (shotgun clause or independent arbitrator)
  - Exit rights (drag-along, tag-along, ROFR)
  - Anti-dilution provisions (if raising capital, protect your %)

### Implementation Roadmap (Option 2)

**Phase 1: Immediate Actions (Week 1-2)**

1. **Legal Consultation**
   - [ ] Same as Option 1: Hire startup lawyer
   - [ ] Focus: Director liability in AUSTRAC-registered entity, equity negotiations, shareholder protections

2. **Founder Alignment Meeting**
   - [ ] Present: "I'm committed to building this together, but I need clarity on equity and roles"
   - [ ] Discuss: Risk exposure (escrow), equity split, decision-making authority
   - [ ] Gauge: Are they open to 40-50% for you? Or expecting equal split (33/33/33)?

**Phase 2: Negotiation (Week 2-4)**

3. **Equity Negotiation**
   - [ ] Present your contribution: 100% technical execution, full-time commitment to product
   - [ ] Acknowledge their contribution: Customer discovery, sales pipeline, domain expertise
   - [ ] Propose: 45% you, 32.5% co-founder 1, 22.5% co-founder 2 (or Scenario A/C depending on leverage)
   - [ ] Justify: "I'm taking on escrow risk I didn't sign up for, so I need adequate equity compensation"

4. **Role Definition**
   - [ ] Clarify: Who makes final decisions on what?
   - [ ] Agree: You have veto on CRM product decisions, they have lead on escrow operations
   - [ ] Document: Decision-making matrix (who approves hiring, budget, strategy, etc.)

**Phase 3: Formalization (Week 4-12)**

5. **Shareholders Agreement**
   - [ ] Lawyer drafts comprehensive shareholders agreement
   - [ ] Include: Equity vesting, roles, decision-making, veto rights, exit provisions, deadlock resolution
   - [ ] All parties review with independent counsel
   - [ ] Negotiate and sign

6. **Corporate Setup (if not already incorporated)**
   - [ ] Incorporate Pleeno Pty Ltd (or formalize ownership of existing PTY LTD)
   - [ ] Issue shares per agreed split
   - [ ] Appoint directors and officers
   - [ ] AUSTRAC registration (for escrow division)

7. **IP Assignment**
   - [ ] Anton assigns all Pleeno CRM IP to company
   - [ ] Ensure company owns all code, designs, documentation
   - [ ] Document any third-party licenses or open-source dependencies

**Phase 4: Operational Management (Ongoing)**

8. **Governance**
   - [ ] Monthly co-founder meetings (strategy alignment)
   - [ ] Quarterly board meetings (formal governance)
   - [ ] Separate P&L tracking for CRM vs. Escrow (transparency on divisional performance)

9. **Risk Management**
   - [ ] D&O insurance policy in place
   - [ ] AUSTRAC compliance program established (Co-founder 2 leads, external consultant advises)
   - [ ] Regular legal/compliance audits

### When This Makes Sense

**Choose Option 3 IF:**
- Relationship is strained or you fundamentally don't trust them as long-term partners
- They refuse to give you adequate equity (e.g., insist on 33/33/33 equal split despite your contribution)
- You want 100% ownership and control of CRM business
- You're confident you can sell CRM to broader market without their customer relationships
- You want immediate liquidity (they pay you upfront for IP license)

### Deal Structure Options

**Option 3A: Perpetual Exclusive License + Upfront Payment**

**Terms:**
- You grant co-founders' company exclusive, perpetual license to use Pleeno CRM for escrow customers in Australia
- Upfront payment: $50K-150K AUD (negotiated based on current value and future potential)
- Ongoing royalty: 5-10% of their escrow revenue OR $2K-5K/month (whichever is greater)
- You retain: Right to sell CRM to non-escrow customers globally
- Support: You provide technical support for 1-2 years (paid separately or included in royalty)

**Advantages:**
- Immediate cash payment (helps fund your own CRM business)
- Ongoing passive income from their escrow business
- You keep 100% of CRM upside for non-escrow market

**Disadvantages:**
- They may resent paying you perpetually ("we gave you the idea, why are we paying you forever?")
- Exclusive license limits your ability to sell to their competitors (if they target escrow providers)

---

**Option 3B: Time-Limited License (5 Years) with Renewal Option**

**Terms:**
- 5-year exclusive license for Australian escrow market
- Upfront payment: $30K-80K AUD
- Annual license fee: $20K-50K/year (declines over time as they potentially build own system)
- After 5 years: They can renew, buy IP outright, or you both part ways
- You retain: All rights to CRM IP, freedom to sell globally immediately

**Advantages:**
- Gives them time to build escrow business, then decide if they want to invest in own CRM or continue licensing
- You have exit after 5 years if relationship sours
- Lower upfront payment may be easier for them to afford (bootstrapped business)

**Disadvantages:**
- Uncertainty after 5 years (will they renew or build competing product?)
- You may lose your biggest customer after 5 years

---

**Option 3C: Full IP Buyout (They Own CRM, You Exit Completely)**

**Terms:**
- Co-founders' company buys 100% of Pleeno CRM IP from you
- Purchase price: $100K-300K AUD (negotiated based on current revenue/traction and future projections)
- Payment: Lump sum or structured (e.g., $100K upfront + $100K over 2 years based on revenue milestones)
- You provide: 6-12 months transition support (paid consulting at $150-200/hour)
- You retain: ZERO rights to CRM IP (they own it fully), but you're free to build unrelated software

**Advantages:**
- Clean break, immediate liquidity
- No ongoing relationship or obligations
- They get 100% control (may be more attractive to them than licensing)

**Disadvantages:**
- You lose ALL future upside if CRM becomes very valuable
- Likely undervalued (hard to get fair price for pre-revenue or early-stage product)
- Emotional: You built it, now someone else owns it

---

**Option 3D: You Keep IP, No License (Compete Directly)**

**Terms:**
- You retain 100% ownership of Pleeno CRM IP
- You do NOT grant them any license
- They must build their own CRM or use generic tool
- You sell Pleeno CRM to study agencies (including their prospects/competitors)
- No ongoing relationship

**Advantages:**
- Maximum freedom and control
- You capture 100% of market opportunity
- No conflicts over licensing terms or fees

**Disadvantages:**
- Nuclear option: Destroys relationship completely
- They will likely badmouth you to industry (reputational risk)
- Legal risk: If there's any ambiguity about IP ownership (verbal agreements, work-for-hire claims), they may sue
- You lose their customer relationships and domain expertise (may struggle to sell without them)

### Valuation Framework for Licensing/Buyout

**How to Value Pre-Revenue Software IP:**

1. **Cost-Based Approach:**
   - Calculate: Hours invested × hourly rate
   - Example: 1,000 hours × $100/hour = $100K (minimum floor)

2. **Market Comparables:**
   - Research: What do similar CRM platforms sell for?
   - SaaS valuation multiples: 3-10x annual recurring revenue (ARR)
   - Pre-revenue: Typically 0.5-2x projected Year 1 revenue

3. **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF):**
   - Project: Future licensing revenue or royalties
   - Discount: By risk factor (pre-revenue = high risk = 30-50% discount rate)
   - Example: $50K/year licensing × 5 years = $250K, discounted to $100K-150K present value

4. **Negotiation Leverage:**
   - If they have zero customers: Your IP is less valuable (they can build own CRM)
   - If they have 10+ signed customers waiting for CRM: Your IP is very valuable (time to market)
   - If you can sell CRM to other agencies easily: Your BATNA (Best Alternative) is strong (demand higher price)

**Typical Range for Pleeno CRM (Pre-Revenue):**
- **Low End**: $50K-75K (cost-based, they have weak customer pipeline)
- **Mid Range**: $100K-150K (projected Year 1 revenue is $100K-200K, 0.5-1x multiple)
- **High End**: $200K-300K (strong customer pipeline, 10+ agencies ready to buy, competitive situation)

### Advantages of Option 3

✅ **100% Ownership & Control**
- You own all CRM IP with zero dilution
- Full autonomy on product, pricing, strategy
- No co-founders to argue with or get approval from

✅ **Immediate Liquidity**
- Upfront payment (if buyout or licensed with payment)
- Funds your runway to build CRM business independently

✅ **Risk Elimination**
- Zero exposure to AUSTRAC, escrow failures, or their business decisions
- If they fail, your CRM business is unaffected

✅ **Freedom to Pivot**
- Can sell CRM to any market (not just study agencies)
- Can build other products without conflict
- Can take on investors or partners without their involvement

### Disadvantages of Option 3

❌ **Relationship Destroyed**
- Clean break likely ends personal/professional relationship
- May burn bridges in study agency industry (small market, word travels)

❌ **Lost Customer Access**
- You lose their network, domain expertise, warm introductions
- Must build sales pipeline from scratch

❌ **Undervalued Exit**
- Pre-revenue IP is hard to price fairly
- You likely sell for less than future value (if CRM succeeds, you'll regret exit)

❌ **Legal Risk**
- If IP ownership is ambiguous, they may dispute and sue
- Legal battle could cost $50K-200K+ and take years

❌ **No Ongoing Partnership Value**
- You don't benefit from their success (if escrow business takes off, you're not part of it)
- Missed opportunity for collaborative growth

### Implementation Roadmap (Option 3)

**Phase 1: Decision & Preparation (Week 1-2)**

1. **Self-Assessment**
   - [ ] Answer: Am I confident I can sell CRM without them? (Honest assessment of sales ability)
   - [ ] Answer: Is this relationship salvageable, or is exit the best path?
   - [ ] Answer: Can I afford 6-12 months runway to build new sales pipeline?

2. **Legal Consultation**
   - [ ] Hire lawyer to review IP ownership status
   - [ ] If ambiguous, get legal opinion on your ownership claim
   - [ ] Understand risk: Could they successfully claim ownership? (If yes, negotiate from weaker position)

**Phase 2: Negotiation (Week 2-6)**

3. **Present Exit Proposal**
   - [ ] Meeting: "I've decided the co-founder partnership isn't the right fit long-term, but I want us to find a fair solution"
   - [ ] Offer: License or buyout terms (use valuation framework above)
   - [ ] Frame: "This lets you focus on escrow, I focus on CRM, we both win"

4. **Negotiate Terms**
   - [ ] Upfront payment amount
   - [ ] Ongoing royalty (if licensing)
   - [ ] License exclusivity and territory
   - [ ] Support obligations
   - [ ] Non-compete (you can't target escrow market? they can't target CRM market?)

**Phase 3: Formalization (Week 6-12)**

5. **Legal Agreements**
   - [ ] IP assignment (if buyout) or license agreement (if licensing)
   - [ ] Mutual release (neither party can sue the other over past equity/ownership claims)
   - [ ] Non-disparagement clause (neither party badmouths the other)
   - [ ] Transition support agreement (if applicable)

6. **Transition**
   - [ ] Transfer code, documentation, credentials (if buyout)
   - [ ] Provide handover training (if licensing)
   - [ ] Setup ongoing support process (if licensing)

**Phase 4: Independent Operations (Week 12+)**

7. **Build Your CRM Business**
   - [ ] Rebrand (if they own "Pleeno" name) or license brand back from them
   - [ ] Build sales pipeline independently (cold outreach, content marketing, partnerships)
   - [ ] Find first 5-10 customers without their help (validates standalone viability)

---

## Option 4: Stay in Undefined Partnership (Status Quo - NOT RECOMMENDED)

### What This Looks Like

- Continue working together without formal equity agreement
- No shareholders agreement, no IP assignment, no defined roles
- "We'll figure it out as we go"

### Why Founders Do This

- Avoid difficult conversations
- Don't want to pay lawyers
- Fear that negotiating equity will damage relationship
- Hope that "success will solve everything"

### Why This Is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS

❌ **Legal Disaster Waiting to Happen**
- IP ownership undefined → lawsuit when company sells or someone exits
- Equity undefined → massive dispute when revenue starts flowing
- Roles undefined → constant conflict over who decides what

❌ **Impossible to Raise Investment**
- Investors will NOT fund companies with unclear cap tables
- First question: "Who owns what?" If you can't answer, deal is dead

❌ **Personal Liability Risk**
- If they incorporate and you're "helping" without equity, you may be unpaid employee (entitled to back wages)
- If you're informal partner, you may be personally liable for business debts (partnership law)

❌ **Relationship Will Deteriorate**
- Resentment builds: "I'm working harder than them but we have no agreement on who gets what"
- Eventually explodes: Someone quits or demands equity, other side refuses, lawsuit follows

### The "Handshake Deal" Fallacy

**Founders often say:**
- "We trust each other, we don't need lawyers"
- "We'll split everything equally when we start making money"
- "It's too early to formalize, we're just testing the idea"

**Reality:**
- Trust is not a legal structure
- Verbal agreements are unenforceable and create ambiguity
- The BEST time to formalize is BEFORE money flows (people are reasonable when there's nothing to fight over)

### IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

If you are currently in undefined partnership:

**This Week:**
1. [ ] Stop all work until you have written agreement on IP ownership
2. [ ] Consult lawyer immediately ($2K now saves $200K lawsuit later)
3. [ ] Present to co-founders: "We need formal equity agreement before continuing"

**If they resist:**
- This is a MASSIVE red flag
- They may be planning to claim majority ownership later ("we brought the idea and customers, you were just the developer")
- Consider exiting immediately rather than continuing undefined relationship

---

## Comparison Matrix: All Options

| Factor | Option 1: Two Entities | Option 2: Single Entity | Option 3: Exit + License | Option 4: Status Quo |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| **Your Equity in CRM** | 60-75% (majority) | 40-50% (minority/equal) | 100% (full ownership) | Undefined (DANGER) |
| **Escrow Risk Exposure** | 0-5% (minimal/none) | Equal to equity % | 0% (none) | Undefined (DANGER) |
| **Control Over CRM** | Full control | Shared/veto rights | Full control | Undefined (DANGER) |
| **Relationship Complexity** | High (2 companies, licensing) | Medium (1 company, clear roles) | Low (clean break) | High (constant ambiguity) |
| **Legal/Setup Cost** | $10K-25K | $5K-15K | $5K-15K | $0 (but $200K lawsuit risk) |
| **Revenue Potential (Your Share)** | High (majority of CRM + licensing from escrow) | Medium (minority of combined business) | Medium-High (100% of CRM, but lose escrow upside) | Undefined (DANGER) |
| **Exit Valuation** | High (CRM is clean asset for acquirers) | Medium (escrow may reduce CRM value) | Medium (you already exited early) | Impossible (can't sell undefined ownership) |
| **Relationship Preservation** | Medium (requires mature partnership) | High (we're all in this together) | Low (clean break likely ends relationship) | Low (resentment builds over time) |
| **Best For You IF...** | You can handle some sales, want majority ownership, tolerate complexity | Customer demand is bundled, you need their sales help, trust them deeply | Relationship is strained, you want full control, can sell CRM alone | NEVER - This is not an option |

## Recommended Decision Framework

### Step 1: Answer These Critical Questions Honestly

**Question 1: IP Ownership Status**
- [ ] Do you currently own the Pleeno CRM IP? (Yes / No / Unclear)
- If unclear or No: **IMMEDIATE LEGAL CONSULTATION REQUIRED** (this is non-negotiable)

**Question 2: Relationship Health**
- [ ] Do you trust co-founders to act in good faith? (1-10 scale)
- [ ] Can you have difficult equity conversations without destroying relationship? (Yes / No)
- If score <7 or No: **Consider Option 3 (Exit) or walk away entirely**

**Question 3: Standalone CRM Viability**
- [ ] Can you validate 5+ customers who would buy CRM without escrow? (Yes / No / Unknown)
- [ ] Can you handle sales independently or afford to hire? (Yes / No)
- If both No: **Option 1 or 2 required (you need their commercial help)**

**Question 4: Risk Tolerance**
- [ ] Are you willing to be a director of AUSTRAC-registered entity? (Yes / No)
- [ ] Can you afford D&O insurance and potential regulatory liability? (Yes / No)
- If both No: **Option 1 (separate entities) or Option 3 (exit) required**

**Question 5: Control vs. Partnership**
- [ ] Would you rather have 75% of $1M business (full control) or 40% of $3M business (shared control)?
- If strong preference for control: **Option 1 or Option 3**
- If comfortable with partnership: **Option 2**

### Step 2: Run the Perplexity Deep Research Tasks (Assigned Below)

Before finalizing your decision, you need data. Assign these research tasks to Perplexity:

**Research Task 1: Australian Study Agency Market Size**
- Total number of international study agencies in Australia
- Breakdown by state (Queensland, NSW, VIC)
- Average revenue per agency
- Growth trends (last 5 years)
- Market concentration (top players vs. fragmented)

**Research Task 2: AUSTRAC Compliance Requirements & Costs**
- Registration process for remittance/escrow services
- Annual compliance costs (legal, audit, reporting)
- Director liability for AML/CTF breaches
- Case studies of AUSTRAC penalties (what went wrong, how much they were fined)
- D&O insurance costs for AUSTRAC-registered entities

**Research Task 3: CRM Competitive Landscape**
- Existing CRM solutions used by study agencies (generic tools like HubSpot vs. niche tools)
- Pricing benchmarks for B2B SaaS CRM in Australia
- SaaS valuation multiples (how much do CRM companies sell for?)
- Acquisition history (who acquires CRM companies in Australia?)

**Research Task 4: Escrow Service Market in Australia**
- Existing escrow providers (competitors to your co-founders' vision)
- Typical escrow fee structures (% of transaction value)
- Market size and growth potential
- Regulatory barriers to entry (how hard is AUSTRAC registration?)

**Research Task 5: Founder Equity Benchmarks**
- Typical equity splits for technical co-founder who built 100% of product
- Typical equity splits when business co-founders bring customers/domain expertise
- Vesting schedules (industry standard in Australia)
- Case studies of co-founder disputes and resolutions

**Research Task 6: Queensland/Gold Coast Startup Ecosystem**
- Startup lawyers specializing in founder equity (who should you hire?)
- Startup accelerators and advisors (who can mediate negotiation?)
- Angel investors in Gold Coast (if you need to raise capital for CRM business)
- Co-working spaces and networking groups (sales channels for CRM)

### Step 3: Make Your Decision

After gathering data, use this decision tree:

```
START: Do you own the IP clearly and unambiguously?
├─ NO or UNCLEAR → STOP. Hire lawyer immediately. Do not proceed until resolved.
└─ YES → Continue
    │
    ├─ Is relationship healthy? (Trust score 7+)
    │  ├─ NO → OPTION 3 (Exit with license/buyout)
    │  └─ YES → Continue
    │      │
    │      ├─ Can you validate standalone CRM demand? (5+ customers willing to buy without escrow)
    │      │  ├─ NO → OPTION 2 (Single entity, negotiate best equity you can get)
    │      │  └─ YES → Continue
    │      │      │
    │      │      ├─ Are you willing to accept AUSTRAC regulatory risk?
    │      │      │  ├─ NO → OPTION 1 (Two entities, separate CRM from escrow)
    │      │      │  └─ YES → Continue
    │      │      │      │
    │      │      │      ├─ Do you prefer control (75% of smaller) vs. partnership (40% of larger)?
    │      │      │      │  ├─ CONTROL → OPTION 1 (Two entities)
    │      │      │      │  └─ PARTNERSHIP → OPTION 2 (Single entity)
```

### Step 4: Execute Your Chosen Path

Once you decide:

1. **Schedule Founder Meeting (This Week)**
   - In-person, not virtual (too important for Zoom)
   - Agenda sent in advance: "Discussing long-term equity and business structure"

2. **Hire Lawyer (This Week)**
   - Get referrals from other startup founders in Gold Coast
   - Initial consultation: $300-500
   - Full engagement: $2K-5K (budget for this)

3. **Present Proposal (Within 2 Weeks)**
   - Use frameworks in this document
   - Frame as win-win, not zero-sum
   - Listen to their concerns, be willing to compromise on details (not principles)

4. **Formalize Agreement (Within 4-8 Weeks)**
   - Signed shareholders agreement
   - IP assignment
   - Vesting schedules
   - Role definitions

5. **Celebrate & Execute (Month 3+)**
   - You now have clarity, alignment, legal protection
   - Focus 100% on building the business (not worrying about equity disputes)

---

## Red Flags: When to Walk Away Completely

Sometimes the best decision is to NOT proceed with co-founders. Walk away if:

🚩 **Red Flag 1: They Refuse to Formalize Equity**
- "We don't need lawyers, we trust each other"
- "Let's wait until we have revenue"
- "We'll figure it out later"
- **Translation:** They want flexibility to claim majority ownership later when you have no leverage

🚩 **Red Flag 2: They Claim Ownership of Your Work**
- "You built it, but we came up with the idea, so we own it"
- "You were working for our company, so it's work-for-hire"
- "We should get 60% because we brought the customers"
- **Translation:** They don't value technical contribution fairly

🚩 **Red Flag 3: They Won't Compromise on Escrow Risk**
- "You have to be a director of the escrow company, no negotiation"
- "We're not willing to separate entities"
- **Translation:** They want you to take risk you didn't sign up for with no exit option

🚩 **Red Flag 4: They Threaten or Manipulate**
- "If you don't agree, we'll tell customers you sabotaged the business"
- "We have the customer relationships, you have nothing without us"
- "We'll just hire another developer and rebuild the CRM"
- **Translation:** This is a toxic partnership, run away

🚩 **Red Flag 5: No Customer Traction Despite Claims**
- They claimed "10+ agencies ready to buy" but have zero signed LOIs or deposits
- Prospect meetings keep getting rescheduled or canceled
- Customer interest is vague ("they're excited about the idea")
- **Translation:** Customer pipeline may be exaggerated to pressure you into unfair equity split

**If 2+ red flags are present: DO NOT PROCEED. Exit immediately and either:**
- Option A: Demand full IP ownership and build CRM business independently
- Option B: Negotiate exit payment and move to a new opportunity
- Option C: Write off the time invested and start fresh (sunk cost fallacy is real - don't throw good money after bad)

---

## Key Negotiation Principles

### 1. Know Your BATNA (Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement)

**Your BATNA:**
- Build and sell CRM independently (retain 100% ownership)
- Get a high-paying job as developer ($120K-150K+ salary in Australia)
- Start a different business with different co-founders

**Their BATNA:**
- Hire developer to rebuild CRM ($80K-120K salary + 6-12 months time)
- License existing CRM tool and customize it
- Run escrow business without CRM initially (lose competitive advantage)

**Leverage Analysis:**
- If your BATNA is strong (you can easily sell CRM alone) → Demand 60-75% equity
- If their BATNA is strong (they have other developers willing to build it) → Realistic equity is 40-50%

### 2. Anchor High, Compromise to Fair

**Negotiation Tactic:**
- Start: "I believe fair equity is 70% for me (technical execution), 20% for you (business), 10% for SME (domain expertise)"
- Their response: "That's ridiculous, we brought the idea and customers, we deserve 50%+"
- Your compromise: "I understand your perspective. What if we do 60/25/15 with vesting? I'm open to discussion."
- Final: Settle around 55-65% (your zone of possible agreement)

**Why This Works:**
- Anchoring bias: First number sets the negotiation range
- By starting high, you leave room to "compromise" to your actual target
- Don't start at your target (e.g., 60%) because you'll get negotiated down to 45-50%

### 3. Separate People from Problem

**Bad Approach:**
- "You guys didn't build anything, I deserve majority equity"
- "I'm the only one adding value here"
- **Result:** Defensive, relationship destroyed

**Good Approach:**
- "I deeply respect what you both contributed - the customer discovery and domain expertise were essential. My concern is aligning risk and reward fairly. I built 100% of the technical product and will continue to own that responsibility. How can we structure equity so we all feel our contributions are valued?"
- **Result:** Collaborative problem-solving

### 4. Use Objective Criteria

Instead of arguing opinions, use data:
- "Industry benchmarks show technical co-founders who build the entire product typically get 50-70% equity"
- "SaaS companies typically value technical execution at 60% of early-stage value creation"
- "Given that I'm taking on AUSTRAC regulatory risk I didn't originally sign up for, fair compensation is X%"

### 5. Create Value, Don't Just Claim It

**Zero-Sum Thinking (Bad):**
- "I want 70%, which means you only get 30% total"
- **Result:** They feel like they're losing

**Positive-Sum Thinking (Good):**
- "What if we structure two entities? I get majority of CRM (my focus), you get majority of escrow (your focus), and we BOTH win because we're optimized for our strengths. The total pie is bigger because we're not fighting over the same slice."
- **Result:** Win-win, relationship preserved

## Success Metrics: How to Know You Made the Right Decision

### 6 Months After Formalization

**Option 1 (Two Entities) - Success Looks Like:**
- [ ] CRM company has 3-5 paying customers (validates standalone demand)
- [ ] Escrow company is paying licensing fees on time (relationship is working)
- [ ] Both co-founders are still engaged and collaborating (relationship preserved)
- [ ] You feel energized about CRM roadmap (not resentful about equity)

**Option 2 (Single Entity) - Success Looks Like:**
- [ ] You and co-founders are making decisions collaboratively without constant conflict
- [ ] CRM and escrow divisions are both growing (shared success)
- [ ] You feel adequately compensated for your contribution (no resentment)
- [ ] AUSTRAC compliance is on track (no regulatory issues)

**Option 3 (Exit) - Success Looks Like:**
- [ ] You've received buyout/licensing payment as agreed
- [ ] You've signed 3-5 CRM customers independently (validates you can sell without them)
- [ ] You feel relief and excitement (not regret)
- [ ] Relationship ended professionally (no badmouthing, no lawsuits)

### 2 Years After Formalization

**Long-Term Success:**
- [ ] CRM business is profitable (or on path to profitability)
- [ ] You're excited about the future (not dreading work)
- [ ] Relationship with co-founders is healthy (Option 1/2) or you're happy you exited (Option 3)
- [ ] You would make the same decision again knowing what you know now

**Long-Term Failure (Learn and Exit):**
- [ ] Constant conflict over equity, roles, or strategy
- [ ] Business is stagnating (market didn't validate product-market fit)
- [ ] You resent the equity structure every day
- **Action:** Negotiate exit, sell your equity, move on (don't stay in bad situation)

## Final Recommendations

### Based on the Information Provided

**My Assessment (Mary, Business Analyst):**

Given that:
1. You built 100% of the technical product
2. They have existing PTY LTD companies (which complicates IP ownership)
3. You have fundamental risk tolerance mismatch (CRM vs. escrow)
4. You're in Gold Coast (access to legal resources, startup ecosystem)

**I recommend: OPTION 1 (Two Separate Entities) as your opening negotiation position**

**Reasoning:**
- You deserve majority ownership of what you built (60-75% of CRM)
- Escrow regulatory risk should not be forced upon you
- Two entities allow both parties to focus on their strengths
- Licensing creates ongoing alignment without shared liability

**Fallback: OPTION 2 (Single Entity) IF:**
- Customer validation shows 80%+ demand is bundled (CRM without escrow won't sell)
- You can negotiate 50%+ equity and protective veto rights
- Relationship is strong enough to withstand shared control

**Nuclear Option: OPTION 3 (Exit) IF:**
- They refuse to negotiate fairly (demand you take <30% equity despite building entire product)
- Relationship is already strained/untrusting
- You discover IP ownership is already assigned to their PTY LTD (legal battle not worth it)

### Next Steps for You (anton)

**This Week:**
1. Book lawyer consultation (IP ownership review) - Budget: $500-1,000

## Conclusion

**anton, you are at a critical decision point.**

The choices you make in the next 4-8 weeks will determine:
- How much of your work you actually own (60-75% vs. 40-50% vs. 0%)
- What risks you're exposed to (AUSTRAC compliance, escrow liability)
- Whether this partnership thrives or ends in legal battle
- Your financial outcome if/when Pleeno is acquired

**The worst thing you can do is continue in ambiguity.** Option 4 (status quo) is not an option.

**The best thing you can do is:**
1. Get legal advice on IP ownership (this week)
2. Gather market data (via Perplexity research, this week)
3. Choose Option 1, 2, or 3 based on data and self-assessment
4. Present proposal to co-founders (week 2-3)
5. Formalize agreements (week 4-8)
6. Focus on GROWTH, not equity disputes (month 3+)

**You built something valuable. Make sure you're fairly compensated for it.**

I (and the rest of the party) are here to help you think through this systematically.

**What questions do you have? What would you like us to explore deeper?**
